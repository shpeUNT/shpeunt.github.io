bio:  This is my second year as part of the SHPE UNT Familia and my first year serving as Secretary. Originally from Houston, TX, I now call Denton, UNT, and SHPE my home! I transferred to UNT in 2023, seeking a student organization that aligned perfectly with my aspirations—SHPE was just that. Enthralled by the support and community I found, I aimed to join the officer team by the end of my first semester to contribute to the organization that offered me so much.  A few fun facts about me. I've been an avid bowler for the past 7 years, participating in multiple leagues and tournaments. I love my two pet geckos, Mac and Missy, who keep me company while I enjoy my favorite audiobooks and podcasts.
