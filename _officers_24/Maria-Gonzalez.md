bio: I’m a first gen student and Junior in Materials Science & Engineering. I grew up playing music, acting in theatre and volunteering with foster kids. Those experiences have helped me learn the discipline and joy that comes with following your passions as well as the impact of being supported by a community of likeminded people. Today, I am working to help the community that has impacted me the most grow through my position as SHPEtinas director. I have 1 fellowship, 1 co-op and 2 internships under my belt and hope to use the knowledge and skills I’ve learned to help our SHPEtinas tap into their full potential.
