bio: Hello! I’m Katrina Ibarra, a dedicated senior majoring in Human Resource Management with a minor in Marketing. As a first-generation college student, my journey has been marked by challenges and triumphs, fueling my passion for creating impactful and supportive workplace environments. My academic path has led me to explore various facets of Human Resource Management and its intersections with other fields. I am considering pursuing a master’s degree in HR and Organizational Behavior, Sports Management, or Workplace Safety. Each area aligns with my commitment to fostering environments where employees feel valued and are ensured a safe return home to their families. I am particularly passionate about workplace safety. The ability to contribute to an environment where employees can work securely and go home safely is deeply meaningful to me. This commitment is rooted in a personal understanding of the profound impact of loss and the importance of safeguarding those around us. In the realm of Human Resources, I am driven by the belief that employees are at the heart of any successful organization. Ensuring they feel heard and valued is crucial to organizational health and functionality. Additionally, my interest in Sports Management is fueled by a love for sports, especially the NBA. I am eager to challenge the stereotypes and gender imbalances within the field and contribute a fresh perspective. My academic achievements include receiving a $1,000 scholarship from the G. Brint Ryan College of Business and having my safety presentations utilized as references in their Workplace Health and Safety courses. I hold an Associate of Science in Liberal Arts from Navarro College, where I graduated on the President’s List. Since transferring in 2022, I’ve continued to make the President’s List at UNT three times. I am actively involved in the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) along with SHPE. I am excited about the opportunity to participate in an HR case study competition in Lafayette, Indiana, in November of 2024.
