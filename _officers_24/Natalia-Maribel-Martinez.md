quote: “You only fail, once you give up”
bio: I am a first-generation daughter with older sibling syndrome. My parents are from Coahuila, Mexico but immigrated to the US in 2000. One of my favorite things to do if I'm not doing presidential duties is running or playing volleyball. I also enjoy going to the movies with friends, and taking my family out to new places I discover while away from home. Alongside my Bachelor's I am minoring in Psychology and Math. The way humans behave has always intrigued me so I decided on a minor. I have been a part of SHPE since Spring 2021. I was the SHPEtinas Director for the 2021-2022 year. Since then I have been involved with SHPEtinas, SHPEHackerz, SHPE Jr, Resume Reviewing, and overall just being a helpful resource to my fellow SHPE Members. It makes me proud to be the President to this amazing organization and I hope to continue to grow the SHPE Vision, Mission and our Familia.
