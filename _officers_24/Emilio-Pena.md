bio: I’m originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana but I moved to Manvel, then deciding to come up to UNT, it’s been an interesting thing to hear especially since I was born and raised in Cajun Country for a majority of my life. I’ve found a community that I’m able to call familia especially since they feel like home to me. I’m still trying to figure out a lot about college especially since I’m first-gen, but I believe I’m getting the hang of it.
