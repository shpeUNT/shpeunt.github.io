      "The <strong>purpose</strong> of SHPEtinas is to build a community that
      empowers women in STEM and help them navigate through a male-dominated
      work and learning environment while accomplishing their own goals. We have
      built a safe and encouraging environment that motivates women to do their
      best in their professional, academic, and personal life, while at the same
      time becoming the best version of themselves."
